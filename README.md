# Space_X
Space X advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website with $62 cost; other providers cost upward of $165, much of the saving is because Space x can reuse the first stage. So if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch. Here we have created a machine learning pipeline to predict the landing.
